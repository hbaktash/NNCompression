Neural networks compression methods 

HashedNet and edge pruning methods are implemented using the most basic tools for a better understanding of their performance.
Results generated by this code discussed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11144).
The codes for pruning methods are easily usable.
Use "./brain_damage_net.py --help" for specifications of input variables. (same for magnitude_iterative_pruning.py)

HashedNet is implemented naively and does not provide a good performance; it is not suggested for big experiments. 
Instead one can use the code provided [here](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ychen/HashedNets/).


The methods were implemented during my 2019 summer internship in INRIA Sophia Antipolis under supervision of [Emanuele Natale](https://sites.google.com/view/enatale) and with help of [Laurent Viennot](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Laurent.Viennot/).
