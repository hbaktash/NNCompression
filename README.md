neural networks compression methods 

HashedNet and edge pruning methods are implemented using the most basic tools for a better understanding of their performance.
The codes for pruning methods are easily usable.
Use "./brain_damage_net.py --help" for specifications of input variables. (same for magnitude_iterative_pruning.py)
HashedNet is implemented naively and does not provide a good performance; it is not suggested for big experiments. 
Instead one can use the code provided here : https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~ychen/HashedNets/


The methods were implemented during my summer internship in INRIA Sophia Antipolis under supervision of Dr. Emanuele Natale and with help of Dr. Laurent Viennot.
